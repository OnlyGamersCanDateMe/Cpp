# 🔷 Shivam's C++ Vault

Welcome to my personal C++ repository — a structured collection of programs and projects built as I learn and master the language. This repo includes:

- ✍️ Fundamental concepts
- 📚 Topic-wise practice sets
- 💻 Hands-on mini projects
- 📂 Real-world use case simulation (ATM Machine)

## 🚀 Featured Project

### 🔹 [ATM Machine Simulator](./Projects/ATM%20MACHINE)

> A fully functional ATM simulation in C++ using classes, encapsulation, and input handling.

- 💳 User login with Account No & PIN
- 💰 Balance check, withdrawal, mobile number update
- 🔐 Encapsulated class design
- 🧠 OOP concepts in action

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- ✅ Mastered basics of C++ syntax and structure
- ✅ Hands-on with arrays, functions, loops, pointers
- ✅ Understood core object-oriented principles
- ✅ Created real-world C++ application simulations

## 🚀 Featured Project

### 🔹 [Student Management System](./Projects/Student%20Management%20System)

> A complete student record management app in C++ using classes, binary file handling, and pointer-based I/O.

- 📝 Add, view, and delete student records
- 🗑️ Recover deleted entries from Trash
- 💾 Binary file I/O with `fstream`
- 🧠 Object-oriented design with class encapsulation

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- ✅ Practiced file handling with binary streams
- ✅ Built CRUD operations using OOP principles
- ✅ Gained experience with pointers, classes, and memory
- ✅ Simulated a real-world academic record system in C++


## 🚧 In Progress

This repository is being actively updated as I learn new topics and build more projects in C++.
