# 🔷 Shivam's C++ Vault

Welcome to my personal C++ repository — a structured collection of programs and projects built as I learn and master the language. This repo includes:

- ✍️ Fundamental concepts
- 📚 Topic-wise practice sets
- 💻 Hands-on mini projects
- 📂 Real-world use case simulation (ATM Machine)



## 📁 Folder Structure

## 🚀 Featured Project

### 🔹 [ATM Machine Simulator](./Projects/ATM%20MACHINE)

    A fully functional ATM simulation in C++ using classes, encapsulation, and input handling.

- 💳 User login with Account No & PIN
- 💰 Balance check, withdrawal, mobile number update
- 🔐 Encapsulated class design
- 🧠 OOP concepts in action

###🔷 [Student Management System](./Projects/SMS)

    A console-based student record management project in C++ using classes, file handling, and binary storage.

    •    📝 Add, read, and delete student records
    •    🗂️ Soft delete with recovery from Trash
    •    💾 Binary file operations (write, read)
    •    📦 Object-oriented design and pointer usage

⸻

## 🧑‍🏫 Learning Outcomes
-    ✅ Applied object-oriented programming in real use case
-    ✅ Practiced binary file handling in C++ with fstream
-    ✅ Gained hands-on with class design, file I/O, and memory management
-    ✅ Created a CRUD-style C++ application with persistence

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- ✅ Mastered basics of C++ syntax and structure
- ✅ Hands-on with arrays, functions, loops, pointers
- ✅ Understood core object-oriented principles
- ✅ Created real-world C++ application simulations



## 🚧 In Progress

This repository is being actively updated as I learn new topics and build more projects in C++.
